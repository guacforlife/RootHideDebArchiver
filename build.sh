# Build both debs into packages/ from the same source, so their versions always match:
#   iphoneos-arm64   rootless, stock Theos (~/theos). Rootless Dopamine and palera1n install it
#                    as is; a roothide phone can only take it through the RootHide Patcher.
#   iphoneos-arm64e  native roothide, ~/theos-roothide, signed with codesign. Roothide Sileo
#                    (Dopamine roothide, Relaxin) picks it over the arm64 deb whatever the
#                    versions, and installs it with no conversion.
# Publish the two together: roothide Sileo prefers arm64e even when the arm64 deb is newer, so
# bumping only one leaves the other kind of phone behind.
#
# Then the roothide deb is checked: nothing under var/jb, every Mach-O has arm64 and arm64e
# slices and both are signed, tweak filter plists are 644, and no file still names /var/jb.
# The Patcher used to rewrite /var/jb; a native build has nothing that does. A file that only
# keeps /var/jb as a rootless fallback goes in .roothide-varjb-ok, one deb path per line.
